# ESP RainMaker + Manual Switch Control for 8 Relays Using ESP32  

 This project provides a seamless integration of manual and cloud-based control of up to 8 relays using the ESP32 microcontroller and ESP RainMaker platform. It enables real-time feedback and synchronization between physical switches and remote controls, ensuring reliable operation even without WiFi connectivity. This project is ideal for smart home automation, allowing control of lights, appliances, or other devices through ESP RainMaker or manual switches.

## Overview  
This project demonstrates how to control 8 relays using an ESP32 microcontroller, with both manual switches and cloud integration via the ESP RainMaker platform. The system provides real-time feedback, ensuring synchronization between physical switch operations and remote control, even in the absence of WiFi connectivity.

## Features  
- **Control Options**: Devices can be operated manually or through the ESP RainMaker app avaliable for both Android and IOS.
- **Integration With Popular Voice Assistants**: Devices Can Be Integrated With Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Updates Device state on the app and via physical switches in real time.  
- **No WiFi Mode**: Operate relays manually when WiFi is unavailable.  
- **Customizable**: Easy to adapt to different devices or configurations.  
- **Secure Provisioning**: Secure WiFi provisioning using BLE or SoftAP.
